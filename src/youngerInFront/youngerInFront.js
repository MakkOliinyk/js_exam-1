 * Implement function youngerInFront:

 * Function takes a natural number N and returns an array with its digits in
 * order from youngest to oldest. Youngest means the last digit in number and
 * oldest means the first one.
 *
 * e.g. for N = 46156 it should return [6, 5, 1, 6, 4]. Make sure all items
 * in returned arrays are numbers. ['6', '5', '1', '6', '4'] is wrong answer.
 *
 * @param {number} N
 *
 * @return {number[]}
